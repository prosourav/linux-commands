git restore . (brings your file to last staged position)

if your file is not stagged stash will not work
if you resently added a file and then bring some changes and now want to remove the new changes git restore .

if you deleted a staged file and wants to bring back - git restore .


if you have deleted a file and by mistake and commited then 
go to your previous commit and copy the hash and then use - 'git reset <hash>' and then use git stash/git restore . you will bring back
your previous file.

here when git reset happen it brings git to a position where deleted operation happened but not added so we use git restore .
to retrive file where we reach at the last commit position.

git remote -V

if some commit is on remote branch and you want to remove one commit then do it on local
 while complete the commit in local and push again use git push origin <branch> -f

while do opensource
1.fork

git rebase -i <commit id>

then add message

if you make commit squash it will go with the commit after it but it should be pick commit
